1. Due to the asynchronous nature, the developers might think that something already happened, for example, their data has already been retrieved, but the action still hasn't taken place.  Loose typing is convenient but could lead to errors in calculation if the developer does not keep track of the variables. Web browsers interpret JavaScript in different ways, which makes it tricky to write code that works for every browser.

2. I think they did that so that the website does not break. Even if the wrong output is printed out, the website would still work. 

3. In compiled languages, the entire code is changed to machine code first leading to faster execution. In interpreted languages, the code is interpreted line by line leading to a slower execution. JavaScript is an interpreted language. One benefit is that changes are reflected immediately because recompilation is not required. One drawback is that errors might remain uncaught till that program is run. 

4. I think the professor wants us to have a strong fundamental basis to build our future learnings on. I think one drawback is that we have to write a lot of code that could just be implemented using a framework.

5. All the steps that we did in the lab would be useful in making our project more structured and interesting. JavaScript would used to implement features and devtools would be used to see how the code performs.
