## Part 1

1. ***What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why.***

Line 9 would print-

values added:  20 

2. ***What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.***

Line 13 would print-

final result:  20


3. ***What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why.***

Line 9 would print-

values added:  20 

4. ***What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.***

Line 13 would give an error, specifically a "ReferenceError". This is because result was declared and defined inside the if block so we cannot use it outside that block. In line 13, result is trying to reference result which was not declared in its block but in an if block. So, we get an error. 


5. ***What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why.***

The code would give an error on line 7 beacuse a const variable cannot be redefined. Thus, we would get a "TypeError". The code would stop before reaching line 9.   

6. ***What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.***

Again, the code would stop on line 7 as a const variable cannot be redefined. Thus, we would get a "TypeError". The code would stop before reaching line 9.
If that error was fixed, line 13 would give an error, specifically a "ReferenceError". This is because result was declared and defined inside the if block so we cannot use it outside that block. In line 13, result is trying to reference result which was not declared in its block but in an if block. So, we get an error.
